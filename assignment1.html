    <h1> Ben Bongutu </h1>
    <ul>
      <li> I have had no prior experience with website development.
        I used to be a nueroscience major on a pre-med track until 
        I realized that medical school was not the path for me. 
        </li>
      <li> My major is Health Information Management.  I am from Erie, PA, 
        which is about 2 hours away.  I played basketball and tennis in high 
        school, but got in a car accident which tore my rotator cuff which prevented me from continuing to 
        play tennis in college.
        </li>
       <li> If I could describe my experience with website development and how I
        currently feel about the class with a picture it would be this.
